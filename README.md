# SQL_from_scratch
Structured SQL learning repository documenting my notes, the examples and practice questions from YouTube resources -- from basics to advanced.

## YouTube Resources I am learning from
[SQL Full Course from Data with Baraa](https://youtu.be/SSKVgrwhzus?si=Kqf1CxDOnu_wQhS8)
<br>
This is by far the only resource that I am currently using to learn SQL.
<br>
The datasets, questions and all the other resources that I am using are from video and you can download all of that from the video's description. You can watch the video if you need any help with downloading the resources.
<br>
For easy access I have a few resources in Resources folder.
<br>
I will keep updating as I progress.
<br>
Right now I am using MySQL as the DBMS to learn and practice basic SQL queries and for advanced queries I will be using postgreSQL.

## Folder Structure
### **Practice**
Contains:
<br>
Questions + answers (I write them to practice and run the queries).

### **Resources**
For now this folder contains the datasets that I am using while learning SQL. It contains two datasets for MySQL and two for postgreSQL. You can find all the resources from the link I mentioned above.
